bugfixes:
  - "Adjusting ansible-core PyPI code to also accept a filename starting with ``ansible_core``, which seems to be in use since ansible-core 2.16.6
     due to `PEP-625 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0625/>`__ support in setuptools 69.3.0 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/158)."
