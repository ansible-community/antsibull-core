bugfixes:
  - "Fix a bug in Galaxy download code when the filename is found in the cache, but the checksum does not match. In that case, the collection was not copied to the destination, and the code did not try to download the correct file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/76)."
