breaking_changes:
  - "Drop support for building Ansible versions less than 6.0.0
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/132)."
removed_features:
  - "``ansible_core`` - remove ``get_ansible_core_package_name()`` function.
    This is no longer necessary now that support for ansible-base has been dropped
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/132)."
  - "``ansible_core`` - remove ansible-core/ansible-base normalization in
    ``AnsibleCorePyPiClient``. Data retrieval is only supported for ``ansible-core``
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/132)."
  - "``dependency_files`` - drop support for ``_ansible_base_version`` and
    ``_acd_version`` in pieces files. ``_ansible_core_version`` and
    ``_ansible_version``, respectively, should be used instead
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/132)."
