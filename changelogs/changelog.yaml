        - Adjust signature of ``DepsFile.write()`` to work around bug in antsibull
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/6).
      deprecated_features:
        - The ``DepsFile.write()`` method will require the first parameter to be a
          ``packaging.version.Version`` object, the second parameter to be a string,
          and the third parameter a mapping of strings to strings, from antsibull-core
          2.0.0 on (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/6).
      minor_changes:
        - Improve typing (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/6).
        - Make config file management more flexible to allow project-specific config

  2.0.0a1:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - Support for Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8 has been dropped. antsibull-core 2.x.y
          needs Python 3.9 or newer. If you need to use Python 3.6 to 3.8, please
          use antsibull-core 1.x.y (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/16).
      deprecated_features:
        - The ``antsibull_core.compat`` module deprecates the ``metadata`` module.
          Use ``importlib.metadata`` instead, which is available from Python 3.8 on
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/16).
        - The ``antsibull_core.compat`` module deprecates the functions ``asyncio_run``,
          ``best_get_loop``, and ``create_task``. Replace ``asyncio_run`` with ``asyncio.run``,
          ``create_task`` with ``asyncio.create_task``, and ``best_get_loop`` with
          ``asyncio.get_running_loop`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/16).
      minor_changes:
        - Add a ``store_yaml_stream`` function to ``antsibull_core.yaml`` to dump
          YAML to an IO stream (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/24).
      release_summary: Alpha release of 2.0.0.
    fragments:
      - 16-compat-deprecation.yml
      - 2.0.0a1.yml
      - 24.yaml
    release_date: '2022-12-09'
  2.0.0a2:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - Remove ``breadcrumbs``, ``indexes``, and ``use_html_blobs`` from global
          antsibull config handling. These options are only used by antsibull-docs,
          which already validates them itself (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/54).
        - The ``install_package()`` method of ``antsibull_core.venv.VenvRunner`` now
          returns a ``subprocess.CompletedProcess`` object instead of an ``sh.RunningCommand``.
          The rest of the function signature remains the same. Most callers should
          not need to access the output to begin with (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/50).
      bugfixes:
        - Remove improper usage of ``@functools.cache`` on async functions in the
          ``antsibull_core.ansible_core`` module (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/67).
        - Restrict the ``pydantic`` dependency to major version 1 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/35).
        - Restrict the ``sh`` dependency to versions before 2.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/31).
      deprecated_features:
        - Deprecate the ``get_command()`` methods of ``antsibull_core.venv.VenvRunner``
          and ``antsibull_core.venv.FakeVenvRunner``. These methods will be removed
          in antsibull-core 3.0.0. Use the new ``log_run()`` and ``async_run()`` methods
          instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/50).
        - The ``doc_parsing_backend`` option from the library context is deprecated
          and will be removed in antsibull-core 3.0.0. Applications that need it,
          such as antsibull-docs, must ensure they allow and validate this option
          themselves (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/59).
      minor_changes:
        - Add ``async_log_run()`` and ``log_run()`` methods to ``antsibull_core.venv.VenvRunner``
          and ``antsibull_core.venv.FakeVenvRunner``. These should be used instead
          of ``get_command()`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/50).
        - Add a new ``antsibull_core.subprocess_util`` module to help run subprocesses
          output and log their output (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/40).
        - Allow Galaxy client to communicate with the Galaxy v3 API (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/45).
        - Replace internal usage of ``sh`` with the ``antsibull.subprocess_util``
          module (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/51).
        - Use the pypa ``build`` tool instead of directly calling ``setup.py`` which
          is deprecated (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/51).
      release_summary: Second alpha release of 2.0.0.

  2.0.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix a bug in Galaxy download code when the filename is found in the cache,
          but the checksum does not match. In that case, the collection was not copied
          to the destination, and the code did not try to download the correct file
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/76).
      deprecated_features:
        - The fields ``ansible_base_url``, ``galaxy_url``, and ``pypi_url`` of the
          app context have been deprecated. Use the fields ``ansible_core_repo_url``,
          ``galaxy_url``, and ``pypi_url``, respectively, of the library context instead
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/81).
      minor_changes:
        - Allow the Galaxy downloader to trust its collection cache to avoid having
          to query the Galaxy server if an artifact exists in the cache. This can
          be set with the new configuration file option ``trust_collection_cache``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/78).
        - Allow to cache ansible-core download artifacts with a new config file option
          ``ansible_core_cache`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/80).
        - Allow to fully trust the ansible-core artifacts cache to avoid querying
          PyPI with a new config file option ``trust_ansible_core_cache`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/80).
        - Allow to skip content check when doing async file copying using ``antsibull_core.utils.io.copy_file()``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/78).
        - Avoid using the collection artifact filename returned by the Galaxy server.
          Instead compose it in a uniform way (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/78).
        - The fields ``ansible_core_repo_url``, ``galaxy_url``, and ``pypi_url`` have
          been added to the library context. If ``ansible_core_repo_url`` is not provided,
          it will be populated from the field ``ansible_base_url`` if that has been
          provided (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/81).
      release_summary: New major release
      removed_features:
        - The unused ``antsibull_core.schemas.config.ConfigModel`` model and the unused
          ``antsibull_core.config.read_config`` function have been removed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/82).

    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix typing for ``antsibull_core.app_context.app_context()`` functions (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/109).
        - '``subprocess_util.log_run`` - use proper string formatting when passing
          command output to the logger (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/116).'
      minor_changes:
        - Declare support for Python 3.12 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/103).
        - '``subprocess_util.async_log_run()``, ``subprocess_util.log_run()``, and
          the corresponding functions  in ``venv`` now support passing generic callback
          functions for ``stdout_loglevel`` and ``stderr_loglevel`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/113).'

  3.0.0a1:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - Drop support for building Ansible versions less than 6.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/132).
        - Remove ``GalaxyClient``'s and ``CollectionDownloader``'s ``galaxy_server``
          arguments. You need to explicitly pass in a ``GalaxyContext`` object instead
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/131).
        - antsibull-core now requires major version 2 of the ``pydantic`` library.
          Version 1 is no longer supported (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/122).
      bugfixes:
        - Avoid superfluous network request when trusting the ansible-core download
          cache (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/135).
      release_summary: First antsibull-core v3 pre-release
      removed_features:
        - If ``ansible_base_url`` is provided in a config file, but ``ansible_core_repo_url``
          is not, its value is no longer used for ``ansible_core_repo_url`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/128).
        - Remove dependency on ``sh`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/119).
        - Removed the deprecated field ``doc_parsing_backend`` from ``LibContext``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/128).
        - Removed the deprecated fields ``ansible_base_url``, ``galaxy_url``, ``pypi_url``,
          and ``collection_cache`` from ``AppContext`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/128).
        - '``ansible_core`` - remove ``get_ansible_core_package_name()`` function.
          This is no longer necessary now that support for ansible-base has been dropped
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/132).'
        - '``ansible_core`` - remove ansible-core/ansible-base normalization in ``AnsibleCorePyPiClient``.
          Data retrieval is only supported for ``ansible-core`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/132).'

          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/129).'
        - '``dependency_files`` - drop support for ``_ansible_base_version`` and ``_acd_version``
          in pieces files. ``_ansible_core_version`` and ``_ansible_version``, respectively,
          should be used instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/132).'
        - '``venv`` - remove ``get_command()`` method from ``VenvRunner`` and ``FakeVenvRunner``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/119).'

  3.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Adjusting ansible-core PyPI code to also accept a filename starting with
          ``ansible_core``, which seems to be in use since ansible-core 2.16.6 due
          to `PEP-625 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0625/>`__ support in setuptools

  3.0.2:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Adjust the aiohttp retry GET mananger to use ``ClientTimeout`` instead of
          a ``float``, since that will be removed in aiohttp 4.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/163).
        - Bump asyncio requirement to >= 3.3.0 instead of 3.0.0. Version 3.0.0 likely
          never worked with the retry code that has been in here basically since he
          beginning (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/163).
        - Make sure that app and lib contexts are cleaned up correctly in case of
          generator exit (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/161).
        - Make sure that the right ``TimeoutError`` is used in the HTTP retry util.
          ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` is a deprecated alias of ``TimeoutError`` since
          Python 3.11 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/160).

          (https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/pull/450, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/168).
        - Antsibull-core now depends on the new project antsibull-fileutils. Some
          code has been moved to that library; that code is re-imported to avoid breaking
          changes for users of antsibull-core (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core/pull/166).
